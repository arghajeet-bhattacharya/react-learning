Why react ?

because of it's composibility

JSX will render only one parent element, but that parent element can have multiple child element
for ex: parent element can be <main>, <section>, <article>

Imperative: give step-by-step instruction to finish an task

Declaritive: simply describe what should be display in webpage & expect the tool to do for you

Composable: breaking an task or problem into smaller sub-tasks / sub-problems and solving them

Props: properties / data passed into component, they are immutable (they can't be changed)
State: value managed by component, they are mutable (they can be changed), any time we have changing values 
    that should be saved/displayed we use state

View as function of state:

1. Render: react runs your function (App, TravelList etc) & display whatever gets returned. The function will run again
only 
    * if it receive new props from above
    * it's internal state values changes

2. setState: changing a local non-state variable doesn't cause react to re-render the component.
    changing state with in-build 'setState' function does

3. view = function(state) : when state changes & react re-render your component, something new get's returned
    & replaced what used to be on page
