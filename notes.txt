Why react ?

because of it's composibility

JSX will render only one parent element, but that parent element can have multiple child element
for ex: parent element can be <main>, <section>, <article>

Imperative: give step-by-step instruction to finish an task

Declaritive: simply describe what should be display in webpage & expect the tool to do for you

Composable: breaking an task or problem into smaller sub-tasks / sub-problems and solving them
